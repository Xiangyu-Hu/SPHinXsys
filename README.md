## Notice on the transformation to heterogeneous computational platform

SPHinXsys is set to undergo a major transformation, moving from traditional CPU parallelism to a new era of heterogeneous parallelism, where compute-intensive tasks can harness the power of both CPUs and GPUs. This evolution will be driven by SYCL (via Intel's DPC++), enabling us to leverage heterogeneous architectures with standard C++. Importantly, this transformation will be achieved with minimal disruption to the existing codebase, ensuring seamless continuity for current users.

The groundwork for this shift is already laid out. A 2D dambreak test case has been added to the `test/test_sycl` folder, showcasing the capabilities of our specially designed framework. What's unique about this framework is that it allows for the development and testing of numerical methods even in environments without GPUs or DPC++ installed. If these methods are crafted following our specified guidelines and prove functional, they will seamlessly operate in environments equipped with DPC++ and GPU support.

By embracing this new paradigm, SPHinXsys is positioning itself at the forefront of multi-physics modeling, where performance meets versatility.

## Master and stable branches

The most active development (or default) branch of this repository is `master`.
This branch gives the updated development of SPHinXsys using heterogeneous (using TBB and SYCL) parallelism.

The most stable branch of the repository is `version1.0`, which is based on CPU (using TBB) parallelism.

## Repository Description

SPHinXsys (pronunciation: s'fink-sis) is an acronym from **S**moothed **P**article **H**ydrodynamics for **in**dustrial comple**X** **sys**tems.
The multi-physics library uses SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics) as the underlying numerical method
for both particle-based and mesh-based discretization.
Due to the unified computational framework, SPHinXsys is able to carry out simulation and optimization at the same time.
For more information on the SPHinXsys project, please check the project website: <https://www.sphinxsys.org>.

## Examples at a glance

Using SPHinXsys library, straightforward and fast multi-physics modeling can be achieved.
Here, we present several short examples in flow, solid dynamics, fluid structure interactions (FSI) and dynamic solid contact.

## Fully compatible to classical FVM method

Through the unified computational framework in SPHinXsys,
the algorithms for particle methods are full compatible to those in the classical finite volume method (FVM).
The following gives an example of the flow around cylinder problem solved by FVM in SPHinXsys.

<a href="https://github.com/Xiangyu-Hu/SPHinXsys/blob/master/tests/2d_examples/test_2d_FVM_flow_around_cylinder/2d_FVM_flow_around_cylinder.cpp">
<img src="https://github.com/Xiangyu-Hu/SPHinXsys-public-files/blob/master/videos/fvm-sphinxsys-flow-around-cylinder.gif" height="168px"></a>

Note that the code for FVM algorithm is exact the same one for particle interaction in SPHinXsys.
The only difference is that SPHinXsys reads a predefined mesh, other than generate particles, before the computation.

## Target-driven optimization

The unique target-driven optimization is able to achieve the optimization target and physical solution all-in-once,
which is able to accelerate optimization process greatly.
The following gives an example of optimizing the conductivity distribution
for a thermal domain problem targeting minimum average temperature.

<a href="https://github.com/Xiangyu-Hu/SPHinXsys/blob/master/tests/optimization/test_2d_VP_heat_flux_optimization/VP_heat_flux_optimization.cpp">
<img src="https://github.com/Xiangyu-Hu/SPHinXsys-public-files/blob/master/videos/optimization.gif" height="192px"></a>

Note that the physical solution of the thermal domain (right) and the optimal distribution of conductivity (left)
are obtained at the same time when optimization is finished.
Also note that the entire optimization process is very fast and
only several times slower than that for a single physical solution with given conductivity distribution.  

## Python interface

While SPHinXsys is written in C++, it provides a python interface for users to write python scripts to control the simulation,
including carry out regression tests for continuous integration (CI) and other tasks.
One example is given below for the dambreak case.
Please check the source code of
[2D Dambreak case with python interface](https://github.com/Xiangyu-Hu/SPHinXsys/tree/master/tests/2d_examples/test_2d_dambreak_python)
for the usage.
