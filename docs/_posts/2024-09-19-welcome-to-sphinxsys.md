## Why SPHinXsys?

SPHinXsys offers a new frontier in simulation technology with the cutting-edge unified multi-physics simulation and optimization library. Harnessing the power of particle-based modeling, the platform addresses the complexities of fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, fluid-structure interactions, thermal analysis, chemical reactions and AI-aware optimizations.
SPHinXsys is characterized with its monolithic strong coupling based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). It ensures seamless, temporal and spatial local coupling with the guarantee of mass, momentum and energy conservation within each individual subsystem and the global system at the same time. It empowers your engineering endeavors with a versatile and intuitive solution across a spectrum of industries.

Find a detailed description of the code philosophy, components, and implementations in the SPHinXsys 
[Computer Physics Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12375) article. 
Whether is fluid dynamics, solid dynamics, heat transfer and problems with reaction, 
or/and their couplings, SPHinXsys is ready for you.
