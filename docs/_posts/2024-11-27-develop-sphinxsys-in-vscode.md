SPHinXsys is suitable for developing in VS Code.

After you installed the VS Code, there are several extensions you will need to install too for accelerating the development.

1. C++ extensions: Microsoft provides a set of extensions for people using C++. You should install them all.  These tools will let you have very similar experience as using VS Studio which is widely used on Windows platform.

2. CMake extensions: CMake, CMake Tools and CMake Language support. These extensions will let you easily generate project, compile, build and debug.

3. Code spell extensions: such as Code Spell Checker. It will help you to avoid spell error when define class names and variables.

4. Git extensions: VS Code has already basic git functions, but you can have more on it. Some advance functions are really helpful for effective version control.

5. Remote SSH: this extension will let you be able to work on SPHinXsys remotely.

6. Clang format extension: you need to install both in VS Code and the system, and then to modify the setting so that very time you save the source code files, the clang format will be automatically imposed.

You may need to search online resources when you try to make use of these extensions.
