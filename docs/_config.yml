  SPHinXsys provides C++ APIs for engineering simulation and optimization. 
  It aims at complex systems driven by fluid, structure, multi-body dynamics and beyond. 
  The multi-physics library is based on a unique and unified computational framework 
  by which strong coupling has been achieved for all involved physics.
