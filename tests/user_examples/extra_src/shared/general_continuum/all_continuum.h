 * SPHinXsys (pronunciation: s'finksis) is an acronym from Smoothed Particle	*
 * Hydrodynamics for industrial compleX systems. It provides C++ APIs for	*
 * physical accurate simulation and aims to model coupled industrial dynamic *
 * systems including fluid, solid, multi-body dynamics and beyond with SPH	*
 * (smoothed particle hydrodynamics), a meshless computational method using	*
 * particle discretization.													*
 *																			*
 * SPHinXsys is partially funded by German Research Foundation				*
 * (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) DFG HU1527/6-1, HU1527/10-1				*
 * and HU1527/12-1.															*

/**
 * @file all_fluid_dynamics.h
 * @brief This is the header file that user code should include to pick up all
 * fluid dynamics used in SPHinXsys.
 * @details The fluid dynamics algorithms begin for fluid bulk without boundary condition,
 * then algorithm interacting with wall is defined, further algorithms for multiphase flow interaction
 * built upon these basic algorithms.
