 *          the interface that simbody states must satisfy in order to be part of the system
 *          and provides a series of helper methods for adding variables
 *          (state, discrete, cache, ...) to the underlying system. As such, SimbodyState
 *          handles all of the bookkeeping of system indices and provides convenience
 *          access to variable values (incl. derivatives) via their names as strings.
