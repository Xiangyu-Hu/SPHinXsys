 * SPHinXsys (pronunciation: s'finksis) is an acronym from Smoothed Particle *
 * Hydrodynamics for industrial compleX systems. It provides C++ APIs for    *
 * physical accurate simulation and aims to model coupled industrial dynamic *
 * systems including fluid, solid, multi-body dynamics and beyond with SPH   *
 * (smoothed particle hydrodynamics), a meshless computational method using  *
 * particle discretization.                                                  *

 * @brief 	This is the base classes of SPH bodies. The real body is for
 *			that with cell linked list and the fictitious one does not.
 * 			Before the definition of the SPH bodies, the shapes with complex
 *			geometries, i.e. those are produced by advanced binary operation,
 * 			such as intersection, should be produced first.
 * 			Then, all shapes used in body definition should be either contain
 * 			or not contain each other.
 *			Partial overlap between them are not permitted.
