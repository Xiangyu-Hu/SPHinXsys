 * SPHinXsys (pronunciation: s'finksis) is an acronym from Smoothed Particle *
 * Hydrodynamics for industrial compleX systems. It provides C++ APIs for    *
 * physical accurate simulation and aims to model coupled industrial dynamic *
 * systems including fluid, solid, multi-body dynamics and beyond with SPH   *
 * (smoothed particle hydrodynamics), a meshless computational method using  *
 * particle discretization.                                                  *
 *                                                                           *
